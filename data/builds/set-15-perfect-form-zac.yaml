notes:
- severity: info
  text: Prioritize 3 Zac items ASAP. Econ up while collecting copies of Zac and Heavyweights.
    Kayle 3 is luxury but not mandatory in the comp.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Roll above 50g for 3* Zac (and potentially Kayle). Add more Wraith and Heavyweights
    as you level. If you are playing for Varus, slam items on Jhin.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Look for 6 Wraith and itemize your Wraith duo carry. Play 4 Heavyweight if
    you can't find Varus. The board spikes hard at 9 if Kayle has items.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Can reroll other units like Kayle and Aatrox, but they're very expensive because
    the goal is to get to 6 Wraith ASAP after you hit Zac 3. Kayle provides built-in
    20% Shred for Zac. Jhin holds Varus items.
