notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around an upgraded Lucian opener with slammed items. Look for Mech and
    a complimentary Sorceror. Collect every copy of Lucian and Aatrox you see.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Slow roll above 50g for Lucian and Senna. Gangplank can item hold for Senna,
    but is not played in final board so don't chase 3*.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: When you hit Lucian 3, level to 7 and roll for Senna 3. Flex in Ryze, Kobuko,
    or Udyr unless you hit Yone. When you finish, level up for 5 costs.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Play with Drift Duos power up and when you see Senna relatively uncontested.
    Play Gangplank until you find Yone. Mech does Magic Damage on its ability so Shred
    is important.
