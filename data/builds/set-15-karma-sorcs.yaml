notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play for winstreak via upgraded Aatrox and Lucian opener. AP items on Lucian,
    Tank on Aatrox.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level for more Mech and Sorcer units to maintain tempo. Swain and Ahri 2 are
    important for stage 4 so make sure to hold.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and look for at least 1 copy of Karma and J4, if you feel stable
    on Swain and Ahri still, you can push level 9 for Gwen, otherwise roll for 2 stars.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Play Kennen until Gwen. Itemize Swain 2 before J4 2. Karma 1 is better than
    Ahri 2. Anti heal goes on Gwen. Ksante 2 is also strong frontline, but you keep
    Kennen. If you get Sorc emblem, put on Ryze and play Xin Zhao over Lux. Otherwise,
    level 9 is Braum.
