notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play for a winstreak opener around any Juggernaut core. Gnar is the best item
    holder for Ashe. Ashe items are more specific but tank items are flexible.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Add more Juggernauts as you level. If you have pairs of key units, you can
    roll a bit for upgrades. Econ up for level 8.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and roll for Ashe and Sett. Zyra is the ideal 8th unit, but the
    spot is flexible. Once stable, push 9 for 5 costs.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Ashe needs Rageblade and Kraken, but the 3rd item is flexible. You can also
    play winstreak 5 Crystal Gambit with 4 Juggernaut for resources. Late game, you
    can downgrade to 4 Juggernaut for 5 costs like Twisted Fate.
