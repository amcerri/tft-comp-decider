notes:
- severity: info
  text: Prioritize Vi items ASAP. It's okay to win or lose streak if you start with
    early Crystal Gambit.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level and roll for Vi 2* on level 6. Aim for 4 Juggernaut + backline carry
    like Jhin. Econ back up and slow roll for Vi 3.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Finish your 3* then push levels. If you are close to Jhin 3, finish him as
    well. Otherwise, you can level for Ashe / Crystal Gambit.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Shown backline carry is Jhin, but you can also play Smolder 3 or Ashe + Crystal
    Gambit. It's also okay to win streak with Crystal Gambit early and take small
    cash outs along the way.
