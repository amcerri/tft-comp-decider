notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around a strong Darius opener to print you gold. Slam items aggressively
    and play for winstreak.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 6 @ 3-2 for more Heavyweights and Supreme Cell. If you have pairs
    of key units, you can roll a bit for upgrades.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 7 and roll for 2* Darius, 2* Jayce, and 6 Heavyweight. Econ up and
    slow roll for your 3*. Level to 8 for Supreme Cell or a 5 cost.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Play with Fusion Dance and eat a 3* Heavyweight (preferably Jayce with Classy).
    Darius items are somewhat flexible as long as you have Infinity Edge + 1 defensive
    item (Omnivamp or Sterak Gage). Smolder can provide anti-heal but backline is
    flexible.
