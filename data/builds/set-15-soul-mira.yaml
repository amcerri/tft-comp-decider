notes:
- severity: info

    Sett and Samira. Position Kalista opposite side enemy carry.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Add Soul Fighters as you level to 6 and 7. If you have pairs of key units
    (mainly the item holders), consider rolling some to hit upgrades.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and roll for Samira, Sett, and 8 Soul Fighter. Any Gwen will spike
    the comp immensely. Put leftover items on the 2nd Edgelord carry.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Soul Fighter emblem is very strong and lets you spike on 8 Soul Fighter without
    having to hit Gwen. Can also flex down to 6 Soul Fighter (cut Kalista and Viego)
    for 5 costs or other units.
