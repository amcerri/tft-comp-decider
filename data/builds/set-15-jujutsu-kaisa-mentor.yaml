notes:
- severity: info
  text: Need Kaisa by early Stage 2. The permanent AD scaling is very important. Stack
    positioning on enemy weak side to kill units.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Roll on 3-2 for 2 star Kaisa and Kobuko. Flex your remaining traits with Heavyweights,
    Duelists, and Supreme Cells. Slowroll above 50 gold.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: After hitting Kaisa 3, push levels for 4 Supreme Cell + 4 Mentor on 8. Cap
    with a 5 cost. Can play for Darius 3 / Yasuo 3 if rich.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Best with early Kai'sa and strong components. Play Kobuko as your primary
    Mentor tank until you hit all 4 Mentors. Udyr's 4 Mentor bonus provides anti-heal
    to the team so prioritize Burn items less. You can also play for Yasuo 3 duo carry
    if very rich.
