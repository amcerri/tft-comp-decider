notes:
- severity: info
  text: Most games, you will play for lose streak Crystal Gambit. If you start your
    streak on 2-3, you can avoid the Double Down grief on Stage 2.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: If you are healthy after 4 losses and uncontested in your streak, you can
    Double Down. Once you cash out, play for the 5 Crystal Gambit kill rewards.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: 'Play 7 Crystal Gambit when possible and farm kills for cashouts. Your frontline
    is flexibe: Udyr, Ksante, Jarvan, and Braum/Mundo are all solid choices.'
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: The power in this trait is winning rounds / killing units with 5 Crystal Gambit
    active. No need to hyper greed for a crazy 500+ reward. Aim for your first cashout
    to spike your board to start winning rounds.
