notes:
- severity: info
  text: Keep Kog'maw / Monster Trainer in for every fight you can to rack up EXP.
    Slam items and play for tempo.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Add more frontline Heavyweight units as you level. If you are holding pairs
    of key units, you can roll some for upgrades.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 7 and roll for 6 Heavyweight + Kog'maw 2. Slow roll for 3* on 7.
    If Heavyweights are uncontested, roll for Darius 3 as well.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Best played with Artifacts. If you get an artifact, you often play Shojin
    + AA. Tank either Kobuko 3 or Poppy. Kog'Maw provides 30% Sunders and Shreds making
    anti-resistance items less important.
