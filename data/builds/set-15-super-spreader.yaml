notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play Malz opener with Blighting Jewel and slammed items. Econ augment can
    also be good because this composition is expensive.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level for missing traits like Prodigy, Heavyweights, or Protectors to save
    hp. If you are rich you can level to 7 on 3-5 and roll but otherwise wait until
    4-1.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 7 and roll for Malz 2 and Rammus 2 and hopefully K'sante 1. After
    that slowroll above 50g for 3 stars.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Best with blighting Jewel. Only play with early Malz and Rammus with AP item
    opener. if no early Rammus play the Heavyweight frontline instead. Ksante takes
    leftover tank items.
