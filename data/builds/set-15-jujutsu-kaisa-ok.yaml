notes:
- severity: info
  text: Need Kaisa by early Stage 2. The permanent AD scaling is very important. Stack
    positioning on enemy weak side to kill units.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Roll on 3-2 for 2 star Kaisa and frontline. Play Rammus ASAP to get Monster
    Trainer EXP. Econ back up and roll for Kaisa 3.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: After hitting Kaisa 3, roll on 7 for Rammus 3 and 4 Supreme Cell. Position
    on same side as enemy carry to snipe them once frontline dies.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Best with early Kai'sa and strong components. Rammus doesn't become a reliable
    tank until Level 15 so you may tank someone else temporarily. Look for Darius
    3 as our secondary carry or Akali with AP items.
