notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around early Sivir and Malphite. Prioritize Malphite items early. Sivir
    falls off very hard late game so she is mainly item holder for Ziggs.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Use your free rolls and excess gold above 50g to look for Sivir 3 / Malphite
    3. If you hit Ziggs 2, you can move items from Sivir -> Ziggs.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Look for Shen and Ziggs 3. Add more Strategists or 5 costs to cap your board.
    If you have extra items / gold, you can chase Janna 3 with items.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Crew Ship is a big damage source so good defensive items on Malphite is key.
    Crew only gives benefit if you have 3*, so play 2 Crew + good synergies until
    you hit the 3* units on your bench. Shop odds for Crew units remain even if you
    level so sometimes you can roll on a higher level.
