notes:
- severity: info
  text: Prioritize Dr Munndo items ASAP. Econ up while collecting copies of Mundo
    and Juggernauts.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 6 and roll for Mundo 2 and 4 Juggernaut + Luchador. You can also
    consider chasing other 3* Juggernauts if you have items for them.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Finish your 3* then level for 6 Juggernaut. Play any ranged 5 cost duo carry
    on 8.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: 4 Luchador with Lee Sin is the late game max cap. You have a higher chance
    to hit Max Vitality if you bench Mundo before using the power up fruit. Play any
    Luchador before Braum. Can also look for Socialite on Aatrox if you don't go tank
    Vi primary.
