notes:
- severity: info
  text: Collect Kayle and Zac while focusing on making econ breakpoints. Prioritize
    taking Kayle items off carousel.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Slow roll for Kayle 3. If you are close 3*, you can roll deeper to hit and
    begin your winstreak. Don't overroll because we need gold to go level 9.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Push levels and add more Juggernauts. You can also play other variations such
    as 6 Wraith or Mech + 5 costs.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Kayle has built-in Shred when you level to 6. Level 9 is a major power spike
    so if you sense you are behind, consider taking an econ augment. Kayle wants a
    damage Power Up, but if you are high rolling you can greed for the Ascending ones.
    Move Zac items to K'Sante 2 lategame.
