notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around early AP Syndra and Prodigies. You can also play 1* Malzahar with
    items if frontline is good.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Flex in frontline based around your opener. When in doubt, add more tanks
    than another damage unit. Econ up for Fast 8.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and roll for Jinx 2 Poppy 2 and Malzahar 2. Always play Varus.
    If you are uncontested Malzahar, you can chase 3*. Push 9 once stable.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Flexible variation of Star Guardians / Malzahar that plays for top 4. Does
    not cap very high unless you get to 9 and get to Varus 2. Better with AP opener
    and give Jinx leftover items, but slam whatever you can for tempo.
