notes:
- severity: info
  text: Prioritize Garen items ASAP. Econ up while collecting copies of Garen. If
    you are finding lots of Ezreals, you can chase 3* Ezreal too.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Roll above 50g for 3* Garen. Add more Battle Academia as you level. You can
    also play for 4 Bastions temporarily while you roll.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: If you abandon Ezreal 3, play for Malzahar / Yuumi instead. Build tank / utility
    items for Leona. Cap with more Prodigy or another 5 cost.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Garen has permanent HP scaling with Battle Academia active so play for the
    trait breakpoints when you can. Yuumi takes leftover AP items. You can also play
    more Bastions in the mid game until you find all the Battle Academia units.
