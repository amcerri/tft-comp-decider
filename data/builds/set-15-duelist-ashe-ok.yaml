notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around Duelist opener or Gnar 2 + Luchador. Colossal Power Up is not
    possible until Stage 3 so don't look for it early.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 6 for 4 Duelist + frontline. Roll a few times if you have valuable
    pairs to upgrades. Econ up for a Fast 8.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and look for Ashe 2 with 6 Duelists. You can roll on 8 for a long
    time for 3*. Play Duelist Lee and Zyra on 9 for max cap.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Ashe needs Rageblade and Kraken, but the 3rd item is flexible. Needs the Colossal
    Power up, go 8 to fit everything since you lose a team-slot and to roll for Ashe.
    Late game look for 2 Colossal on Lee Sin 2.
