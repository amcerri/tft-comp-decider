notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around early Sivir and Malphite. Prioritize Malphite items early. Sivir
    falls off very hard late game, but she can hold items for now.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Once you hit Sivir 3 / Malphite 3. Move up to level 6 for 4 Protector and
    start rolling for Jhin 3 / other 3* Protector. Use Crew leveling to get to 7.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Finish your 3* then start pushing levels for more Snipers. If you can't get
    to Jhin 3, look for Jinx 2 carry instead. Varus at 9 with items is your max cap.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Play this Crew variant when you have mainly AD items. Roll for Jhin 3 at 6
    instead of prioritizing Shen / Ziggs 3. Protector 3* units may change every game
    so be willing to abandon / chase based on what you hit.
