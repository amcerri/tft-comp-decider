notes:
- severity: info
  text: Keep Kog'maw / Monster Trainer in for every fight you can to rack up EXP.
    Slam items and play for tempo.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Add more frontline units as you level. If you are holding pairs of key units,
    you can roll some for upgrades.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 7 and roll for 6 Protector + Kog'maw 2. Slow roll for 3* on 7. Only
    hold extra Jannas if very rich in gold / items. Otherwise play for 5 costs.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Best played with the Caretaker Power Up and artifacts. If you get an artifact,
    you often play Shojin + AA. Tank either Neeko 3 or Ksante. Kog'Maw provides 30%
    Sunders and Shreds making anti-resistance items less important.
