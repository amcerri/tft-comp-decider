notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play for winstreak with an upgraded Syndra with Rising Chaos. You can also
    itemize Ezreal. When in doubt, take Rod components.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Add more Bastions, Academia, and Prodigy units as you hit them. Econ up for
    level 8. Malzahar primary is strong during this mid-game.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and look for 5 Battle Academia and Malzahar / Yuumi. Level to 9
    for Seraphine / 5 Prodigy to cap your board.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Main game plan is to stall for Yuumi so 2 sets of tank items is very powerful.
    If you are very rich, you can also chase Malzahar 3. Only play for 7 Battle Academia
    if you have emblems.
