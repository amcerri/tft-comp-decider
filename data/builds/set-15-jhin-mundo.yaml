notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around a Gnar 2 opener with Juggernauts. Don't overly focus on Jhin items.
    Mundo items matter more early game on average.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 6 and roll for Jhin 2, Mundo 2, and more Juggernaut frontline. Transition
    your Power Snax to Jhin. Econ up back to 50g and roll for 3*.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Finish your 3* at level 6 then push levels for more Juggernauts or Varus.
    Cap the board with either 6 Juggernaut Lee or 4 Luchador.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: 'Look for the Power Up: Spirit Sword. Gnar buffs adjacent allies with damage,
    but don''t always greed it if it griefs positioning. Jhin can also hold a defensive
    item like Hand of Justice or Gunblade if there''s lots of backline splash.'
