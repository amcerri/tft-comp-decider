notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around early Gnar and Mundo. Gnar 2 ideally has the econ Power Ups like
    Golden Edge or Midas Touch. Prioritize winstreaking with heavy econ.

  text: 'Stabilize on Level 8 before going to Level 9. You will likely have to flex
    4 costs who can hold Varus items: Samira, Jinx, Volibear, etc.'

  text: Get to level 9 and look for Ksante 2 and Varus 2 as your anchors. Leftover
    AP items on Zyra.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 5-1
- severity: info
  text: Legendary cap version of Varus and a duo carry in TF or Zyra. Make sure you
    have a mana item for Varus (Blue Buff > Shojin but both are good). Itemize whichever
    duo carry you 2* first (TF 2 > Zyra 2 > TF `1).
