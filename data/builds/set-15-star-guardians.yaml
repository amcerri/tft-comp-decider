notes:
- severity: info
  text: Play around Syndra 2 or Xayah + Rell opener. Slam items aggressively. BIS
    is generally not as important as being strong at all phases of the game.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 2-1
- severity: info
  text: Add more Star Guardians and frontline as you level. You can play Battle Academia
    temporarily as well. Finish 3 items for Jinx.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 3-1
- severity: info
  text: Level to 8 and look for Jinx and Poppy. Flex in Kobuko, Braum, or another
    frontliner until you hit Seraphine.
  triggers:
    stage_min: 4-1
- severity: info
  text: Much weaker without Star Guardian Emblem. Star Guardians win with team effort
    so your duo carry can change every game (Seraphine 2 > Ahri 3 > Xayah 3 / Syndra
    3). Seraphine takes any leftover items. Either go shojin+gathering force Jinx
    or sky piercer+kraken. Prismatic is hard to activate so only chase if you start
    snowballing early. If you play Best Defense Poppy, play the Alt Build Poppy (Sterak
    + Vow + Crownguard).
